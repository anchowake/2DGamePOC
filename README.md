# 2D Game MVP

This is a small MVP designed to explore and learn the process of developing a complete 2D game within Unreal Engine. The project employs an orthographic camera and various techniques to create an authentic 2D experience inside the 3D engine.

It includes a simple interaction script for NPCs and items, along with a basic character controller.
